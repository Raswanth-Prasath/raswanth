## Introduction

This is a template post that shows you the basic structure and formatting you can use when creating blog posts for your portfolio. You can modify this template for your own content.

## Section 1: Main Content

Write your main content here. You can use standard markdown formatting:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for secondary emphasis
- [Links](https://example.com) to external resources
- Code snippets with syntax highlighting

### Subsection

You can organize your content with multiple levels of headings.

## Section 2: Code Examples

You can include code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Section 3: Images

To include images in your posts, place them in `/assets/images/fullsize/posts/your-post-name/` directory and reference them like this:

```
{% picture pimage /assets/images/fullsize/posts/your-post-name/image.jpg --alt Image description %}
```

## Conclusion

Edit this template with your own content and remember to:

1. Update the front matter (title, subtitle, author, tags, etc.)
2. Set `selected: y` if you want the post to appear on the home page
3. Replace the image path with your actual post image
4. Delete this template when you're ready to publish your first real post

Happy blogging!
